Testing Hashes:
    - maybe find avg number of hashes per bin?
    - Test Name (distribution of bins, time, whatever else)
        - Hash Name
            - Stats (m, n, k, whatever), -1
                -Test i, val, val, val, ..., val, -1, Test i+1, val, val, ...
                    - -1 acts as end point!

Testing Blooms:
    - Test Name (false positive rate, time complexity (trade-offs?)) --> in the end, 2 graphs each per hash (3-4 total)
        - Hash Name
            - k1, val, k2, val, ..., ki, val, -1
avg times   - t1, t2, t3, ..., ti, -1
                    - -1 acts as end point!
